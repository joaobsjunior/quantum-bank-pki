# Quantum Bank PKI

PKI assets and integration layer for runtime certificate provisioning.

Initial responsibilities:

- OTK-driven certificate bootstrap flow
- CSR intake and certificate issuance integration
- Open source PKI evaluation and implementation, such as OpenXPKI if KrakenD does not cover the required lifecycle
- mTLS trust material for local development and deployment environments

## Phase 1 Contract Ownership

The PKI layer owns this Phase 1 contract:

- [Certificate Lifecycle Contract](docs/contracts/certificate-lifecycle.md) for CONT-01 certificate profiles, CSR intake, issuance, renewal, revocation, trust anchors, and OpenXPKI fallback.

Later PKI implementation must provide trust material consumed by KrakenD while keeping certificate lifecycle ownership outside the gateway.
